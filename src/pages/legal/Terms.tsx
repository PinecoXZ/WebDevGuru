            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("Client") and WebDevGuru Studio ("WebDevGuru", "we", "us", "our"), a web design and development studio based in India.</p>

            </div>
            <p>These Terms apply to all visitors, enquirers, and paying clients. Project-specific terms in a signed Statement of Work (SOW) or proposal take precedence over these general Terms where there is a conflict.</p>

            <div className="section-number-custom">03 / Engagement</div>
            <h2>Project Engagement Process</h2>
            <h3>Scope Call</h3>
            <p>All projects begin with a complimentary scope call to understand your requirements, timeline, and budget. This call is non-binding. No work commences until a proposal is accepted and a deposit is received.</p>

            <h3>Proposal &amp; Agreement</h3>
            <p>Following the scope call, we issue a written proposal outlining scope, deliverables, timeline, pricing, and revision rounds. Your acceptance (via email, digital signature, or payment of deposit) constitutes agreement to the proposal and these Terms.</p>

            <h3>Kickoff &amp; Timeline</h3>
            <p>Work begins within 3–5 business days of receiving the agreed deposit. Project timelines are estimates based on normal client responsiveness. Delays caused by late feedback, missing assets, or unresponsive clients will extend the timeline proportionally without penalty to WebDevGuru.</p>

            <div className="highlight-box-custom">
              <p>Our standard delivery timeline is <strong>21 calendar days</strong> from kickoff for a complete website, subject to the complexity defined in the proposal and timely client cooperation.</p>

            <div className="warning-box-custom">
              <p>All deposits are <strong>non-refundable</strong>. They compensate WebDevGuru for time reserved and preliminary work performed. If a client cancels after the deposit is paid, no refund will be issued for that deposit amount.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Transfer of Ownership</h3>
            <p>Upon receipt of final payment in full, WebDevGuru transfers to the Client all ownership rights to the final website code, design files, and assets created specifically for the project ("Deliverables"), except as noted below.</p>

            <h3>WebDevGuru Retains Rights To:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All pre-existing code libraries, UI frameworks, and internal toolkits used in the build</li>
              <li>The right to display the completed project in our portfolio, case studies, and marketing materials (unless a formal non-disclosure agreement is signed)</li>
              <li>Any proprietary animation systems, Web Audio synthesizers, or internal component libraries incorporated into the project</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Third-Party Assets</h3>
            <p>Stock images, icons, fonts, and plugins licensed from third-party providers remain subject to those providers' licensing terms. The client is responsible for ensuring continued compliance with any third-party licences after project delivery.</p>

            <h3>Open Source</h3>
            <p>Our projects often incorporate open-source libraries (React, TypeScript, Lucide, etc.). These are governed by their respective licences (MIT, Apache, etc.) and are not subject to this IP clause.</p>

            <h2>Revisions &amp; Scope Changes</h2>

            <h3>Included Revision Rounds</h3>
            <p>Each plan includes a defined number of revision rounds as specified in the proposal:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sprint MVP Plan:</strong> 2 rounds of design revisions, 1 round of development revisions</li>
              <li><strong>Growth Flagship:</strong> 3 rounds of design revisions, 2 rounds of development revisions</li>
              <li><strong>Enterprise Custom:</strong> As defined in the proposal</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Counts as a Revision</h3>
            <p>A revision round is a consolidated set of feedback on the current deliverable. Feedback must be submitted in a single document or message. Piecemeal feedback over multiple messages may be grouped into a single revision round at our discretion.</p>

            <h3>Scope Creep</h3>
            <p>Any request that adds functionality, pages, or features not defined in the original proposal is considered a scope change. Scope changes are quoted and billed separately, and extend the delivery timeline accordingly. We will not commence scope-change work without written confirmation from the client.</p>

            <p>A successful project requires active collaboration. As a client, you agree to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide all required content (copy, images, logos, brand assets) within 5 business days of project kickoff unless a content creation service is included in your plan</li>

            <div className="highlight-box-custom">

            <h3>Mutual Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>Both parties agree to treat as confidential any non-public information shared during the engagement, including business strategies, pricing, technical architecture, and client data. This obligation survives the termination of the project for a period of 2 years.</p>

            <h3>Portfolio Right</h3>
            <p>Unless a specific NDA is signed, WebDevGuru retains the right to feature the completed work in our portfolio, on social media, and in case studies. We will not share confidential business metrics without your permission.</p>

            <h3>NDA Requests</h3>

              <li>Uninterrupted or error-free operation after delivery — websites require ongoing maintenance and hosting hygiene</li>
              <li>Compatibility with future browser versions, OS updates, or third-party API changes after delivery</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>

              <li>Completed deliverables will be delivered upon payment of any outstanding balance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Termination by WebDevGuru</h3>
            <p>WebDevGuru reserves the right to terminate an engagement if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The client fails to make payment within 7 days of a due date</li>
              <li>The client provides content or instructions that are illegal, defamatory, or violate third-party rights</li>

            <h3>Project Abandonment</h3>
            <p>If a client becomes unresponsive for more than 7 consecutive days without notice, the project will be considered abandoned. Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due. Resumption of an abandoned project is subject to availability and may incur a restart fee.</p>
